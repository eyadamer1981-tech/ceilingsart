## Managing Internal Link Mappings

2. Click **"Internal Links"** in the sidebar

### Adding a New Link Mapping

1. Click **"+ Add New Mapping"**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Keyword**: The word/phrase to link (e.g., "fitness tips")
   - **URL**: Where it should link to (e.g., "/services/fitness" or full URL)
   - **Priority**: Higher numbers = applied first (useful for conflicting keywords)
   - **Max Occurrences**: How many times to link this keyword per post (default: 1)
   - **Case Sensitive**: Check if "Fitness" and "fitness" should be treated differently
   - **Active**: Uncheck to temporarily disable without deleting
   - **Description**: Optional note for your reference

3. Click **"Create Mapping"**
